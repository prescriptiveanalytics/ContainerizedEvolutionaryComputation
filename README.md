# Containerized Evolutionary Computation
An extensible Evolutionary Computation (EC) system for containerized and distributed execution. This system is based on the projects [Ai.Hgb.Common][common], [Ai.Hgb.Runtime][runtime], [Ai.Hgb.Dat][dat] and [Ai.Hgb.Seidl][seidl] of this organization.

The ./src folder in this repository contains the *Containerized Evolutionary Algorithm Library (CEAL)*, from which algorithms can be loaded and run, once the runtime ([Ai.Hgb.Runtime][runtime]) is started.

Note: The documentation for this repository to facilitate full setup is currently in progress.
